#  Algorithm Analysis Project

This project explores, implements, and compares **sorting**, **searching**, and **graph algorithms** using Python.  
It aims to analyze their performance and efficiency across multiple datasets through visualization and quantitative comparison.

##  Project Overview

The project is divided into three main tasks:

### **Task 1: Data Exploration and Sorting Algorithms**
- Perform statistical analysis on the datasets (mean, median, min, max, etc.)
- Identify informative columns and visualize data (tables, histograms, plots)
- Implement and compare sorting algorithms:
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**
- Measure and visualize execution time and efficiency across datasets

### **Task 2: Search Algorithms and Binary Search Trees (BST)**
- Implement and compare:
  - **Linear Search**
  - **Binary Search**
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- Evaluate performance and efficiency for search operations (e.g., finding most frequent airline, flight delays, etc.)
- Compare with Python dictionary lookups

### **Task 3: Graphs and Connected Components**
- Model a **flight network**:
  - Nodes represent airports
  - Edges represent flights between airports
  - Edge weights correspond to flight frequencies
- Build and visualize the graph using **NetworkX**
- Implement **DFS** and **BFS** to find connected components
- Compare performance and execution time between methods
